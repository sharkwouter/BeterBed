# BeterBed

A minecraft plugin which makes beds better. It adds the following functions:

- Players are fully healed after using a bed.
- Beds can be used to set your spawn point and heal during the day.
- Armor and weapons are hidden when laying in a bed.

**note:** if the server crashes while a player is laying in a bed, the equipped armor and weapons may be lost. Stopping the server normally does not cause this issue.
